# Robot-Agent-Network-
Robot Agent Network is a decentralized system where Raspberry Pi–based robotic agents run Fetch.ai uAgents to self-discover, share data, negotiate tasks, and coordinate actions without a central server. It enables autonomous, edge-AI-driven collaboration and scalable multi-robot problem-solving.
